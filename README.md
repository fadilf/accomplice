# Accomplice

> *"The AI designed to do the things real AIs are too polite to mention."*

**Accomplice** is a web-based **parody/joke tool** designed to look and feel like a high-end, autonomous AI performing complex tasks. It features a sophisticated modern aesthetic, a chat interface, and a simulation engine that generates absurd, chaotic, and often creative "plans" to achieve user objectives. It is purely for entertainment and performs no actual actions.

## Overview

Accomplice is effectively "theater code" — it doesn't actually perform real-world actions. Instead, it **pretends** to do things with conviction and style. When given a task (e.g., "Make me rich"), it breaks it down into a series of highly specific subtasks and "executes" them in real-time.

### Key Features

*   **ChatGPT-Inspired Aesthetic**: A clean, sophisticated modern AI interface with smooth transitions, responsive design, and a premium feel.
*   **Suggested Tasks**: Rotating inspiration for tasks, from "teaching my cat to file my taxes" to "planning a heist to steal all the pens at the office."
*   **Nested Subtasks**: Granular task execution that breaks down complex plans into sequential, multi-layered steps for a more immersive simulation.
*   **Customizable Execution**: Adjust the "Response Style" (Absurd, Grounded, or Evil Genius) and control the "Execution Speed" via the settings menu.
*   **Live Metrics Panel**: A slide-out dashboard displays simulated real-time metrics like CPU Load, Net Flux, and Captured Assets.
