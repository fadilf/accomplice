# Accomplice

> *"The AI designed to do the things real AIs are too polite to mention."*

**Accomplice** is a web-based **parody/joke tool** designed to look and feel like a high-end, autonomous AI performing complex tasks. It features a "cyber" aesthetic, a chat interface, and a dummy simulation engine that generates absurd, chaotic, and often illegal-sounding "plans" to achieve user objectives. It is purely for entertainment and performs no actual actions.

## Overview

Accomplice is effectively "theater code" — it doesn't actually hack mainframes or destabilize economies. Instead, it **pretends** to do these things with conviction and style. When given a task (e.g., "Make me rich"), it breaks it down into a series of highly specific, ridiculous subtasks and "executes" them in real-time.

### Key Features

*   **Cyber-Hacker Aesthetic**: Built with a sleek, dark-mode UI inspired by sci-fi interfaces. Neon accents, scanlines, glitch effects, and monospace typography create a premium "underground" feel.
*   **Absurd Planning Engine**: Generates dynamic checklists based on a dictionary of chaotic verbs and high-value targets.
    *   *Sample Step*: "Syphon funds from Panamanian Shell Companies via Starlink."
    *   *Sample Step*: "Infiltrate IoT Toasters to mine Dogecoin."
*   **Live Dashboard**: A slide-out panel displays simulated real-time metrics:
    *   **CPU Load**: Fluctuates realistically.
    *   **Net Flux**: Tracks fake data throughput in Terabytes/second.
    *   **Risk Level**: Monitors the "detection" probability.
    *   **Captured Assets**: A running tally of "funds" generated by the operation.
*   **"Thinking" Simulation**: Visualizes the agent's decision-making process before plan execution, adding to the immersion.
